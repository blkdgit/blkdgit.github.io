                <h1 class="mbr-section-title align-center mbr-white pb-3 mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-1"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The Sect of Materialism</span></h1>
                
                <div class="mbr-text align-center mbr-white pb-3">
                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">A sect is also a religion, in the sense of something that you pay your allegiance to and worship on the ladder of material success. And a sect is a group of people who all believe in the same way, looking for the same goals and so on. So really, the biggest religion on the planet today, unfortunately so, is materialism. Because everybody is worshipping money, everybody is worshipping material success. It’s a huge sect. And everybody is becoming very eager to join this sect: they go to universities to get big degrees so they can be the leaders of this sect. They hope they will find what everybody’s looking for, which is pleasure. But of course, because were spirit soul - we are not the body - it’ll never work. It’s false propaganda, fake news. The ultimate fake news is: “You are the material body, and if you join this sect of materialism, if you become very good in this religion, then you can be happy”. Of course, it’s not true, because we are spirit soul. All the material success and everything that comes with that does not satisfy the soul.<br><br>People are afraid of joining sects, so they are afraid: “Be careful, because this might be a sect!”. If it’s anything different, then they think it’s a sect. But the biggest sect on the planet is the one that they embrace whole-heartedly and try to force you to be a member of. And if you say: “You know, I think Ill just step outside and take another way of life” they go “Oh no, no - there might be a sect out there!”. So it’s really a joke when you look at it. <br><br>I read a report very recently: after a large survey and research they determined that the 3 things that are the most detrimental to mental health are Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook - in that order. And this is where people live today, this is part of the sect, part of the illusion. They say “You’ll be happy here!”. I also just read an article by the ex-vice president of Facebook. When Facebook was created it just had a few followers. And the designers of Facebook actually consciously decided that they would create a system that would attract people and make them addicted. So it was done consciously. But he realised that now, when there are 2 billion followers of Facebook - this has turned into a monster. And his statement was: “This is destroying the social fabric of society”. And he said he would not let his children touch it. <br><br>The reason he is the ex vice president is because when he realised what was going on and how much damage it was actually causing, he quit. He made this statement to the media simply to alert people to what he knew from the inside. He was saying in this article that people’s lives are totally dependent on the smiles, the hearts, and the thumbs up that they get. The likes: “Swipe right so you like me and don’t go left because then you don’t like me”. So they whole world is just wondering which way the swipe is going to go. Right: “I’m so happy!”, Left: “Oh, I’m depressed”. This is such a fake world, it’s so shallow, and it’s really causing big big problems in people’s lives. This is not just a little bit good and a little bit bad, this is serious stuff. And more and more people are getting more involved every day, becoming more and more addicted. As a result, the fruit is more depression, more anxiety, less social interaction between people, and just emptiness in life. <br><br>It’s like everything - social media could be used for an amazingly good purpose. Because it connects people: it gives you access to millions of people, billions. If there’s 2 billion people on Facebook you could access 2 billion people, theoretically. Everybody wants to be liked, that’s the key word, like and share. So we think we’re the body and we want people to like our material presentation of ourselves. “Look how I am, look at how I look, look at how attractive I am, how cool I am, how much fun I’m having in the world!”. When inside, the soul is not experiencing any happiness or pleasure. And because they’ve got nothing else - they have no real spiritual knowledge, spiritual foundation, spiritual source of happiness - they have to go somewhere to get what they know they need as a spirit soul. They know they need happiness, relationships, approval. They know they need to be secure and protected, but because we’re in ignorance we go to the wrong place. So, the sect that I was referring to has created all these places for us to go. <br><br>It’s so sad, because if have real guides in our life, people who really care about us, they will take us in the right direction. They won’t put us in illusion and say we’ll be happy if we achieve this or that materially, get more likes, or whatever. They tell you: none of that will work, because you’re spirit soul - you need a spiritual relationship, a real spiritual relationship. One that’s actually functional, with the Supreme Lord. That’s what we’re missing in life. We’re trying to be happy without God. It’s impossible, you cannot do it. Because the soul’s source of happiness is the Supreme Person, God himself. How can I be happy when I don’t have the only one thing that will truly make me happy? I can’t be.<br><br>So I have all these other ways to try to fulfil that need, which never works. And the more failures we have, the more empty we feel, the more disappointed we are - the more we give up hope. I just received a message from a girl who was very depressed. She was really having a hard time in life, she had no hope in life. Because she had high-level material education and she had the things that are supposed to work for you, and it wasn’t working. She was basically just thinking “There’s no hope”, feeling like that. Then she met this Bhakti yoga progress, the people who are teaching this, became friends with them, started associating with them, chanting the mantras, understanding this philosophy, and understanding who she really is. Not her pretend, external self. She just told me “Now there is hope, whereas before there was no hope”. And when you completely run out of hope then the next station is: “Why live? For what?”. If there’s no hope, then why live?<br><br>I just gave a lecture called ‘Lost in the World’. Everybody’s lost, and there’s an example I was thinking of recently. This took place just one and a half month ago in California, in a big national park east of Los Angeles (San Diego area, southern California) called Joshua Tree National Park. This park is big, really big, and it’s a desert. There was this young couple, I think the girl was probably 24 and the guy was 26. They were hiking, they left their car in a parking lot and went on a hike on one of the trails. And they somehow got lost. ‘Lost in the World’, right?<br><br>So they wound up up some canyon, and ran out of water. And they basically lost hope. They were completely dehydrated - I am assuming, because they found water bottles along the way where they had water but then they drank it. They were searching for 2 weeks and finally someone found them. They were both dead and had killed themselves with a pistol. The guy had a pistol, it was registered in his name. They ran out of hope, and the conclusion from the authorities was that is was a joint decision. There was no hope, and so they both killed themselves together. So that’s what happens in life when there’s no hope, you run of options. They ran out of options: we have no water and we don’t know where we are. And it was still really hot. So they figured: “Let’s end it all right now”. So that’s what a lot of people do, they think “Let’s just end it all right now, let’s just get out of here”. Because if there’s no hope, why live? Nobody is going to find us, we won’t survive, so let’s just end it all.<br><br>If you’re lost, you’re lost. But if you are found - meaning that you know who you are, you’ve found the meaning in life which is to develop your loving relationship with the Lord, and you actually are acting in that capacity and experiencing that exchange between you and God - then you are actually seeing: “Yes, there is every reason to live, there’s absolute hope”. When I use the word absolute I mean eternal absolute spiritual hope. It’s a completely different life, and this is real life. This is the only solution.<br></p>
